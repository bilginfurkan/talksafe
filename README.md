## Warning
This is basically a prototype. I do not recommend you using this project, because it was written with ancient frameworks (like jQuery) and I didn't care about programming patterns when coding this, just wanted to get a working demo ASAP.

## Legal stuff
This project was made for educational purposes only. I do not take responsibility if this project gets used by malicious people for malicious intents.
